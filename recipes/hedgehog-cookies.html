    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cute hedgehog cookies. Note: Pecans give the best coating because of the color variation. For a nut allergy, a mix of graham cracker crumbs and one or two chocolate wafer cookie crumbs (remove the cream filling) will give a close look.</p>
    <p>Makes 24 cookies.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter-flavored shortening</li>
        <li>¼ cup corn syrup</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup pecans</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk sugar, shortening, corn syrup, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Stir sugar mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Refrigerate dough until chilled, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li> <br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li> <br>
        <li>Scoop cookie dough using a cookie scoop or 1 tablespoon so all the cookies are uniform; shape dough into teardrop-shaped cookies. Flatten the pointed side of each cookie to form the 'face'. Arrange cookies on baking sheets.</li> <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li> <br>
        <li>Pulse pecans in a food processor until finely chopped; transfer to a bowl.</li> <br>
        <li>Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.</li> <br>
        <li>Dip the top of each cookie in the melted chocolate, spreading to fully coat the 'body' of each hedgehog. Press cookies, chocolate-side down, into the ground pecans forming the 'fur'. Arrange cookies on a sheet of waxed paper to set, about 30 minutes.</li> <br>
        <li>Transfer the remaining melted chocolate to a piping bag or plastic bag with a corner snipped. Pipe chocolate onto the pointed end of each cookie for eyes and a nose.</li>
    </ol>
